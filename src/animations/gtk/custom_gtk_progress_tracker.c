/*
 * Progress tracker is small helper for tracking progress through gtk
 * animations. It's a simple zero-initable struct, meant to be thrown in a
 * widget's private data without the need for setup or teardown.
 *
 * Progress tracker will handle translating frame clock timestamps to a
 * fractional progress value for interpolating between animation targets.
 *
 * Progress tracker will use the GTK_SLOWDOWN environment variable to control
 * the speed of animations. This can be useful for debugging.
